## New Version Submission
This is a new version submission. In this version I have:

* In the comments from an earlier submission it 
  was requested to include a reference for this
  method if possible in DESCRIPTION. Currently a 
  reference is not publicly available online, 
  however we will update the package accordingly 
  once there is. We are aiming to have a preprint 
  up soon, but would like to have the package set 
  up with CRAN before submission to a journal.
