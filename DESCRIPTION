Description: A genetic analysis tool and variance component 
    model for identifying marginal epistasis between pathways 
    and the rest of the genome. MAPITR uses as input a matrix 
    of genotypes, a vector of phenotypes, and a list of 
    pathways, and iteratively tests each pathway for epistasis 
    between any variants within the pathway versus any 
    variants remaining in the rest of the genome. MAPITR
    returns results in the form of p-values for every pathway 
    indicating whether the null model of there being no 
    epistatic interactions between a pathway and the rest of 
    the genome can be rejected.
