* Got Travis-CI page going

###### Since previous version (v0.1.0)

* Added repo to Travis-CI page
* Added 'wCovs' version

###### Notes
* Added Roxygen2 comments for .rda files in '/data'
* Worked through 'devtools::check()' notes, warnings, and errors
* Peter Carbonetto provided some edits that account for v0.1.2, v0.1.3, & v0.1.4 (all edits for getting last parts of Travis-CI setup working)
