Description: MAPITR is a genetic analysis tool for 
    identifying marginal epistasis between pathways and the 
    rest of the genome. MAPITR uses as input a matrix of 
    genotypes, a vector of phenotypes, and a list of pathways, 
    and iteratively tests each pathway for epistasis between 
    any variants within the pathway versus any variants 
    remaining in the rest of the genome. MAPITR is based on 
    a variance component model and returns results in form 
    of p-values for every pathway indicating whether the 
    null model of there being no epistatic interactions 
    between a pathway and the rest of the genome can be 
    rejected.
