## New Version Submission
This is a new version resubmission. In this version I have:

* In this resubmission I have created non-
  OpenMP versions of the code.
* In the comments from an earlier submission it 
  was requested to include a reference for this
  method if possible in DESCRIPTION. Currently a 
  reference is not publicly available online, 
  however we will update the package accordingly 
  once there is. We are aiming to have a preprint 
  up soon, but would like to have the package set 
  up with CRAN before submission to a journal.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.2
* ubuntu 16.04.6 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (release & devel), R 4.0.2 & R 2020-09-17 r79226
